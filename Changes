Revision history for Perl extension Math::Clipper.

1.00  Mon Sep 19 08:48:00 2011
  * WARNING * This release contains incompatible changes!

  - Upgraded the Clipper library to the newest available version 4.3.0.

  - Clipper 4.3.0 has various interface changes, see the documentation
    for details. Most importantly, the coordinates are now 64bit
    integers instead of floating point numbers.

  - Clipper 4.3.0 now works with large integers internally instead of
    floats. Thus, this release adds support and tests for Clipper's
    int/double conversions.

  - Add ex_execute() for ExPolygons.

  - Add use_full_coordinate_range() method.

  - Remove broken is_clockwise() function and replace with
    is_counter_clockwise(), which is what the C++ function
    IsClockwise() has been doing all along.

  - area() is now a function instead of a method.

  - Exposes polygon_offset function.

  - force_orientation related functions are gone.

  - Compilation fixes for Windows perls and compilers.

  - Internals:
    => Use ExtUtils::Typemaps instead of the deprecated
       ExtUtils::Typemap.
    => Moved all XS++ types to the clipper:: C++ namespace to avoid
       collisions on Win32.
